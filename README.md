# TAMBOLA
Tambola, also known as Housie or Bingo, is a popular number-based game played widely for entertainment. This project focuses on developing a digital Tambola game that automates ticket generation, number calling, and result validation, making the game more efficient, fair, and user-friendly compared to the traditional manual method.
